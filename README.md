I built this as a way to track groceries I purchased, and when I expected them to get stale. It turned out to be a pretty useful way to mess around with [Snowpack](https://www.snowpack.dev/), and explore new methods of using [Cloud Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/) APIs.

## Note

This project was built with Node.js version 14, and using a later version may break the build.
